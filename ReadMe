In this people are allowed to borrow a bike from a 'dock' which is computerised meaning user enters payment information and system unlocks the bike.
After usage bike can be returned to any dock belonging to same provider.

Objective:
To model the demand for shared bikes based on given independent variables, thereby management can know how the demands vary with different features.
Therefore, this will be a good way to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

Approach followed:
Using Linear Regression Model to predict this demand for the bikes.
